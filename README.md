# 66_Plus_One
Add 1 to a given list of numbers assuming the whole list as a single number and show the result as a list
# 728_Self_Dividing_Numbers
A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.
# 747_Largest_Number_At_Least_Twice_of_Others
In a given integer array nums, there is always exactly one largest element.
Finds whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array.
# 859_Buddy_Strings
Given two strings A and B of lowercase letters, return true if and only if we can swap two letters in A so that the result equals B.
# 260_Single_Number_III
Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.
# 917_Reverse_Only_Letters
Given a string S, return the "reversed" string where all characters that are not a letter stay in the same place, and all letters reverse their positions.
# 345_Reverse_Vowels_of_a_String
Write a function that takes a string as input and reverse only the vowels of a string.
# 287_Find the Duplicate Number
Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.
# 8_String to Integer (atoi)
Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.
# 151_Reverse Words in a String
Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.
# 41_First Missing Positive
Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer.
# 315_Count of Smaller Numbers After Self
You are given an integer array nums and you have to return a new counts array. The counts array has the property where counts[i] is the number of smaller elements to the right of nums[i].
